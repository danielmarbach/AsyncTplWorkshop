     * Exercise:
     *  Use `Task.Run` in combination with `CpuBound.Compute` to sort multiples arrays of size 10..13 in parallel
     *  Discuss with your peers what happens and why
     *
     * Bonus:
     *  - What happens to the thread of execution, is it blocked or not?
     *  - What could you change to address the above effect?
     *  - How could you achieve something similar to what we did with Parallel.For?
     *  - How would you implement the parallelism limitation?
     *
     * Hint:
     *  - You can use `PrintCurrentThread` or other Helpers to print i.ex. the current managed thread ID
