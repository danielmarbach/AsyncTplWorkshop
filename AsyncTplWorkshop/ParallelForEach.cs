    /*
     * Exercise:
     *  Use `Parallel.ForEach` in combination with `CpuBound.Compute` to sort multiple arrays of size 10..15 in parallel
     *  Limit the parallelism to 4
     *  Discuss with your peers what happens and why
     *  Play with the parallelism constraints
     *
     * Bonus:
     *  - What happens to the thread of execution, is it blocked or not?
     *  - What could you change to address the above effect?
     *  - What sort of magic is Parallel.ForEach using behind the scenes to take the above change into account?
     *
     * Hint:
     *  - You can use `PrintCurrentThread` or other Helpers to print i.ex. the current managed thread ID
     *  - You can use `Enumerable.Range` to create numbers to pass to `CpuBound.Compute`
